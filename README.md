# MAT_Lib_DISH_KASA_SBD
A material library for DISH and KASA resource persons

Hi team. This github page is created to for storing and retrieving the material data for the simulation load cases across DISH and KASA product category. The data stored here is not a comprehensive list, but will be updated everytime a user request for adding a new material into the database. Consider this as a material database management system that stores all the required inputs for the simulation for various physics we are handling at SBD.
